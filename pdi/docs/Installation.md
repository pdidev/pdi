# Installation of %PDI {#Installation}

There are three ways to install %PDI:
1. the [pre-compiled binary packages](https://repo.pdi.dev) for Debian, Fedora
   and Ubuntu,
2. [Spack recipes](https://github.com/pdidev/spack),
3. the source distribution.


## Installation using binary packages {#installation_using_binary_packages}

The [pre-compiled binary packages](https://repo.pdi.dev) are recommended on
distributions where they are available: Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu.
They do however require root access and do not offer full control over the
compilation options used.

## Installation using Spack recipes {#installation_using_spack_recipes}

[PDI recipes](https://github.com/pdidev/spack) for [Spack](https://spack.io) are
recommended when root access is not available, on other distributions, or when
requiring fine control over the compilation options used; for example on a
supercomputer.

## Installation from source {#installation_from_source}

The \subpage Source_installation "source distribution" is available if for some
reason one prefers not to use Spack.
